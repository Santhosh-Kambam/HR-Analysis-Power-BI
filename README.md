# HR Analysis Dashboard : Python and Power BI

## Project Overview

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of an HR dataset to uncover key insights into employee demographics, compensation, and workforce trends. The analysis combines data manipulation and visualization techniques using **Python (Pandas)** with an interactive **Power BI Dashboard** to create a powerful, data-driven tool for HR and management. The primary goal is to empower leaders with actionable intelligence to make informed decisions on talent management, recruitment, and retention strategies.

## Key Findings & Insights

### Workforce Demographics and Stability
The company's workforce consists of **239 employees** with a near-equal gender split. The majority of the workforce is on a permanent contract (70%), indicating a strong focus on stability and long-term retention.

* **Total Employees:** 239
* **Gender Ratio:** The workforce is almost perfectly balanced, with 127 male and 125 female employees.

### Compensation and Geographic Distribution
Compensation varies across departments, with **Business Development** and **Legal** roles having the highest average salaries. Geographically, the workforce is distributed across several countries, with a significant presence in the United States, India, and a notable number of remote employees. Interestingly, remote employees have a higher average salary ($84,000) than their on-site counterparts, suggesting these roles may be more senior or specialized.

### Hiring and Trend Analysis
An analysis of hiring dates reveals a strategic trend. The company experiences a distinct **surge in hiring during March, September, and October**, which may align with specific business cycles or fiscal planning. This insight can help HR teams better allocate resources for future recruitment drives.

## Recommendations

Based on the analysis, here are a few actionable recommendations:

* **Strategic Recruitment:** Given the clear spikes in hiring, HR can optimize recruitment campaigns and budget allocation to focus on the high-recruitment months of March, September, and October.
* **Compensation Review:** Conduct a deeper review of salary benchmarks, particularly for departments with lower average salaries, to ensure they remain competitive and to mitigate potential future attrition risks.
* **Support for Remote Workforce:** Explore the factors contributing to the higher average salary for remote employees to understand if their roles require different support or compensation structures.
